# Zaki-Kidane-DSProject
This is a huffman file-compression project for Data Structures 1 at CU Boulder. 

Input:
  1. In.txt - which is a one-line sample text.
  2. Multiline.txt - a relatively large text file of about 11,000 lines. 
 
 Compression Output (compressed.txt): 
 
  A text file that contains only 0's and 1's which, which represent characters in the input file. 

Decompression Output (decompressed.txt): 

Should be the same as the original file, which is the decoded form of the comppressed.txt output file.
